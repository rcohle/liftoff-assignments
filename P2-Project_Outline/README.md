# Project Outline
## Rosanna Cohle

### Overview

I will be building a website to serve my current dog-walking and dogsitting customers, and to advertise to potential clients. The website will include a login for existing customers; when they log in, customers will be able to view data like their schedule and past walks. They will also have access to photos I have taken of their pets. The site will also include information for potential customers as well a page for customers reviews/testimonials. There will also be FAQ and general informational pages.

More advanced features I'd like to include are a billing/payment setup that can accept credit cards, Paypal, Google Payments, etc., and a service map utilizing google maps. I'd also like to implement a calendar that automatically updates based on information I put into a database. 

### Features
Login and authentication for customers.
customers Page with walk history, pictures, schedule, payments due, etc.
FAQ page including service area, contact information, email link
Testimonials/Ratings page with posting access for registered clients only.
Homepage will have a rotating picture of happy dogs I've walked!

### Technologies
MySQL for storing client login info, appointment details, etc.
Dropbox or other picture hosting device for pictures
Google Maps API for service area
Javascript or Python+Flask+Jinja

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn the Google Maps API and make it interact smoothly with my site.
I'll need to figure out how to make a ratings system.
