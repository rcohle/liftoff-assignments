### Overview
I will be building a website to serve my current dogwalking and dogsitting clients, as well as advertise to potential clients. The website will include a login for existing clients; when they log in, clients will be able to view information on their schedule and past walks. They will also have access to photos I have taken of their pets. The site will also include information for potential clients as well a page for client reviews/testimonials. There will also be FAQ and general informational pages.

More advanced features I'd like to include are a billing/payment setup that can accept credit cards, Paypal, Google Payments, etc., and a service map utilizing google maps. I'd also like to implement a calendar that automatically updates based on information I put into a database.
